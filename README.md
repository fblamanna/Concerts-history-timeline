This script returns a .csv file with all information about the concerts for a single band or artist, available on the setlist.fm website.

## Input

The algorithm takes as input the artist name (just for naming the output file) and the Musicbrainz MBID (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) code, which is an identifiable code for each artist or band in the database. I'm now working on an automatic call artist name - code. In the meantime you have to manually add the code available on the Musicbrainz website.
